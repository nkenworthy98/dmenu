#+TITLE: dmenu - dynamic menu

* dmenu
dmenu is an efficient dynamic menu for X.

* Requirements
In order to build dmenu you need the Xlib header files.

* Installation
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dmenu is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dmenu
(if necessary as root):

#+begin_src shell
make clean install
#+end_src

* Running dmenu
See the man page for details.

* Patches and Other Changes
** Patches
- [[https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/alpha/][dmenu-alpha-20210605-1a13d04.diff]] (transparency)
  + Make sure to add Xrender to LIBS in =config.mk=. Without doing this, I wasn't able to get transparency to work.

    To do this, change
    #+begin_src shell
LIBS = -L$(X11LIB) -lX11 $(XINERAMALIBS) $(FREETYPELIBS)
    #+end_src
    to
    #+begin_src shell
LIBS = -L$(X11LIB) -lX11 $(XINERAMALIBS) $(FREETYPELIBS) -lXrender
    #+end_src

** Config.h Changes
- Changed font to =Terminus=
- Changed status bar colors:
  + Foreground: =#2d6280=
  + Background: =#000000=
- Added and configured any variables required for patches
